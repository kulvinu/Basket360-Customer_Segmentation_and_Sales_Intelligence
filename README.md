## 🚀 Project Objectives

- 🧠 **Understand Customer Behavior**  
  Perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on engagement and transactional value.

- 📈 **Analyze Revenue Trends**  
  Track revenue and sales quantity over time to detect seasonal patterns, sales cycles, and peak periods.

- 💰 **Estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**  
  Predict long-term value of customers to support marketing, retention, and acquisition strategies.

- 🛒 **Measure Average Basket Size & Order Value**  
  Evaluate purchasing habits and trends to better understand consumer behavior.

- 🌍 **Visualize Geographic Insights**  
  Explore how sales are distributed across different countries and regions.

- 📊 **Deliver a Business-Ready Dashboard**  
  Create a dynamic Tableau dashboard tailored for business stakeholders in e-commerce and digital marketing.
